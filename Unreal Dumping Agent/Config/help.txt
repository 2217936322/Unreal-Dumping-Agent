**How To Talk With Me**
In most cases, you will need to select a target.

__Select Target__
```
You can tell me
"find target" to automatically find the target process,
"set target 1234" OR "set target 0x1ABC" for custom target id.
```

__Finder__
```
You can tell me
"find GNames/GObjects" to start finder.
It will list the possible addresses for GNames/GObjects.
In most cases, it will return three addresses. The first two are static addresses, and the third is the relative address. You must select one of the first two. The third will not work (it's for reference only).
```

__Set__
```
You can tell me
"set gnames 0x123456ABCD" OR "set gobjects 0x123456ABCD" to set a custom address (if the finder doesn't work).
This will also verify the address is valid.
```

__SDK Generator__
```
SDK Generator tells me to generate an SDK for your UnrealEngine Game.
You can tell me
"sdk dump", "sdk gen" or "sdk".
And I will generate an SDK for you.
