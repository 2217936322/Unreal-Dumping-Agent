**How To Talk With Me**
Most of cases you will need to select a target.

__Select Target__
```
You can just tell me
"find target" for automatic find good target,
"set target 1234" OR "set target 0x1ABC" for special target id.
```

__Finder__
```
You can just tell me
"find GNames/GObjects" to start finder.
Will give posible addresss for GNames/GObjects.
Most of cases will give u 3 address,
first two will be a static address, 3th will be the relative address.
You must select one of first two, 3th will not work (it's just to know this address)
```

__SDK Generator__
```
SDK Generator is asking me to generate sdk for UnrealEngine Game.
You can just tell me
"sdk dump", "sdk gen" or "sdk".
and i will start generate sdk for you.
```
